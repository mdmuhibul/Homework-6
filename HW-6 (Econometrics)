Two academic articles: 

Article 1: Due to covid-19 as well as Russia-Ukraine conflict, how does it impact on economic downturn and recession in asian countries like 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal. These countries are facing global economic challenges. Rising commodity prices and a surge in imports in 
the second half of FY22 resulted in a widening Balance of Payments (BoP) deficit and accelerating inflation.  Real GDP growth is expected to 
slow in FY23 as import suppression measures disrupt economic activity. 


Article 2: Influence of covid-19 on labor market in USA. In January 2022, Brookings Metro published a report that assessed the impact of long Covid on the labor market. 
Data on the condition’s prevalence was limited, so the eport used various studies to make a conservative estimate: 1.6 million full-time equivalent workers 
could be out of work due to long Covid. With 10.6 million unfilled jobs at the time, long Covid potentially accounted for 15% of the labor shortage. 
This June, the Census Bureau finally added four questions about long Covid to its Household Pulse Survey (HPS), giving researchers a better 
understanding of the condition’s prevalence. This report uses the new data to assess the labor market impact and economic burden of long Covid, 
and finds that: 
Around 16 million working-age Americans (those aged 18 to 65) have long Covid today.
Of those, 2 to 4 million are out of work due to long Covid.
The annual cost of those lost wages alone is around $170 billion a year (and potentially as high as $230 billion).

Question 3 of exam 1:

attach(Household_Pulse_data)
summary(Household_Pulse_data)

summary(dat_use)
regression1 <- lm(worried_people ~ WRKLOSSRV, data = dat_use )
summary(regression)

Household_Pulse_data$worried_people <- Household_Pulse_data$WORRY == "nearly every day worry"
summary(Household_Pulse_data$worried_people)
dat_use <- subset(Household_Pulse_data,use_varb) 

# people who lost their jobs are more worried than the others whi didn't lose their jobs.
# as 5.729 t value for people who didn't lose their jobs is more than the 16.429 for people who recently lost their jobs.
# The results from causation of workloos and worry is statistically significant because of the p-values.

# We can use a subset of people who live in califronia  , and for the people who born in 1996
